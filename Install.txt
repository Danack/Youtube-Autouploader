How to create your Youtube app key
==================================



Synology web server
===================

1) Login to you Synology's web interface and open the control panel.

2) Click 'Web services' and then 'Enable Web Station'.

3) Click virtual host and enter:
	'phpyoutube' for the sub-folder.
	'phpyoutube.com' for the hostname.
This will create a directory in the default volume named as /volume1/web/phpyoutube or similar.

4) Connect to the Synology Diskstation through Finder/Explorer and extract the contents of the PHP Youtube uploader into that directory. 

6) SSH into to your Synology box (ssh root@10.1.2.200).

7) Check that the full path that your web service is running is "/volume1/web/phpyoutube". If it's not you'll need to find which 
volumn the 'Web station' is running on and use that to setup Cron below. 

To make the URL accessible.

Linux web server + cron
=======================


Cron setup
==========

1) Edit the file /etc/crontab (vi /etc/crontab) and assuming you copied the files to the directory "/volume1/web/phpyoutube" add
the following line EXACTLY.

30    1    *    *    *    root   php /volume1/web/phpyoutube/uploader.php cron=true >> /volume1/web/phpyoutube/uploader.log

If the uploader in a different directory please replace both instances of '/volume1/web/phpyoutube' with the appropriate directory name.

2) Restart the cron service to make the changes live "synoservice --restart crond"


Final setup steps
=================

0) Edit the config.php file to use your values for username, password, appname and appKey.

1) If you setup a Synology or Linux web server check that the web server is running correctly by going to http://10.1.2.200/phpyoutube/ 
You should see a web page showing the Uploader page

2) (Optional) Create an entry in your hosts file to make the uploader accessible directly via it's own URL. This file is /etc/hosts on my Mac 
and is c:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts on Windows platform. Just add the line:
10.1.2.200	phpyoutube.com

You should now be able to see the uploader page by going to the URL phpyoutube.com in your web browser.

3) (Optional)Install the Google Chrome extension 'LocalLinks':
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jllpkdkcdjndhggodimiphkghogcpida

This will allow you to view the video files through your web browser (if you're using Chrome).


How to use uploader
===================

1) Copy the video files you want to upload into the 'Uploader' directory.

2) Go the web page for the uploader e.g. http://10.1.2.200/phpyoutube/ or phpyoutube.com

3) You will then see a list of the video files in the directory.

4) Click on 'Create info' to set the info for that video. Click 'Save info' to save the info, or cancel to return to the previous
screen without saving. If you have the 'LocalLinks' extension installed you will be able to play the video without downloading it again.

5) Wait. The video files that have info files created will automatically be uploaded to Youtub at 1.30am (or whatever time you set in the
crontab file).

or

6) (Optional) Click 'Force upload' to force the file to be uploaded straight away through the browser. This isn't recommended for large files
but is useful for testing that everything is working and small files.

or 

7) (Optional) Run the command 'php uploader.php' in a command line window to run the upload
